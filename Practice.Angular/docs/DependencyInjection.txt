1. Types of ProvidedIn:
- providedIn: 'root':
  The service is available application-wide and is a singleton. It is provided in the root injector.
  This is the most common and recommended way to provide services that are used throughout the application.

- providedIn: 'platform':
  The service is provided in the platform injector, which is shared across all applications on the page.
  This is less commonly used and is suitable for services that need to be shared across multiple Angular applications running on the same page.

- providedIn: 'any':
  A new instance of the service is created for each lazy-loaded module that injects it.
  This is useful for services that should not be singletons across the entire application but should be shared within a module.

- providedIn: Type<any>:
  You can specify a specific module to provide the service in by using the module's type.
  This means the service will be available only within that module and its children.
