1. Prevent Angular to generate special attribute like "_ngcontent-*", 
make sure that component and all parent components of that component have encapsulation setting to be ViewEncapsulation.None 
(Apply as global scss)

2. Extends a component in Angular just extends class, not extends configuration of parent component 
(Each configuration inside @Component({}))

3. Difference between each type of ViewEncapsulation:
- Emutated: By default, Angular uses emulated encapsulation so that a component's styles only apply to elements defined in that component's template. 
  In this mode, the framework generates a unique HTML attribute for each component instance, adds that attribute to elements in the component's template, 
  and inserts that attribute into the CSS selectors defined in your component's styles.
- None: This mode disables all style encapsulation for the component. Any styles associated with the component behave as global styles.
- ShadowDOM: This mode scopes styles within a component by using the web standard Shadow DOM API. 
  When enabling this mode, Angular attaches a shadow root to the component's host element and renders the component's template and styles into the corresponding shadow tree.
  This mode strictly guarantees that only that component's styles apply to elements in the component's template. 
  Global styles cannot affect elements in a shadow tree and styles inside the shadow tree cannot affect elements outside of that shadow tree.
