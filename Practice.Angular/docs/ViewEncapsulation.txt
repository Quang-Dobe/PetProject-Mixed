1. Prevent Angular to generate special attribute like "_ngcontent-*", 
make sure that component and all parent components of that component have encapsulation setting to be ViewEncapsulation.None 
(Apply as global scss)

2. Extends a component in Angular just extends class, not extends configuration of parent component 
(Each configuration inside @Component({}))
